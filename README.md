## Getting Started

Getting Started with Quasar should be pretty straight-forward. <Ins>The only step I would recommend doing before using it</Ins> is making a backup of your mod folders on your Switch's SD.
This will allow you to revert easily to your mods before you used Quasar, if that's your wish.

### Prerequisites

Being on Windows, having Admin rights for the installation.
You also need the [.net 5.0 runtime here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-5.0.13-windows-x86-installer)

On your Switch, you will need both [ARCropolis](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/) and [Skyline](https://github.com/skyline-emu/skyline)

### Installing

Install the provided .msi in the [releases section](https://github.com/Mowjoh/Quasar/releases/latest)


### Using it

Quasar is an app that relies on the website https://gamebanana.com  
To download mods for use, please head to the website and look for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate mods.
When you browse the page, it will display a Quasar Download link.
