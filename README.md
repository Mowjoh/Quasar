# Quasar
Mod downloader, manager, "installer" for Super Smash Bros Ultimate and later on, other Switch games

## Getting Started

Getting Started with Quasar should be pretty straight-forward. The only step I would recommend doing before using it is making a backup of your mod folders on your Switch's SD.
This will allow you to revert easily to your mods before you used Quasar, if that's your wish.

### Prerequisites

Being on Windows, having Admin rights for the installation.

### Installing

Install the provided .msi in the releases section


### Using it

Quasar is an app that relies on the website https://gamebanana.com  
To download mods for use, please head to the website and look for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate mods.
When you browse the page, it will display a Quasar Download link.
Click it and the mod will be downloaded by Quasar and ready for use.
