## Getting Started

Getting Started with Quasar should be pretty straight-forward. <Ins>The only step I would recommend doing before using it</Ins> is making a backup of your mod folders on your Switch's SD.
This will allow you to revert easily to your mods before you used Quasar, if that's your wish.

### Prerequisites

Being on Windows, having Admin rights for the installation.

### Installing

Install the provided .msi in the [releases section](https://github.com/Mowjoh/Quasar/releases/latest)
